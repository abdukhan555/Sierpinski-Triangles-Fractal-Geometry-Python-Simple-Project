## Code that creates Sierpinski triangles, a classic example of fractal geometry.

### Algorithm:
Perform the following steps in sequence:

1 Define a set with three points that determine the vertices of an isosceles triangle

2 Randomly pick a point inside the triangle

3 Randomly choose one of the vertices of the triangle

4 Get the midpoint between the points selected in steps 2 and 3

5 Repeat steps 3 and 4 N times, in sequence

 For large N, a fractal figure known as a Sierpinsky triangle will be generated.
